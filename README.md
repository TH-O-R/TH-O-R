## Hey, I'm SALAH ⚡

I build, break, and rebuild things until I understand them.  
Currently diving deep into computer engineering, system internals, and low-level C code.  
I like projects that make me *think* — But! I also care about *how* things look.

---

### Some things I tinker with
- Linux (I use Arch btw)
- C mainly, plus a mix of other tools when needed: shell scripting, Lua, Python, Java, and more
- Servers, virtualization, and the occasional bad idea
- Open-source code that teaches me something new
- Customizing my system to the max: from CLI to TUI to GUI

### Philosophy
> If I can’t explain how it works, I don’t really understand it.

### Elsewhere
GitHub’s my digital workbench... It's where I throw my experiments.
Sometimes they work. Sometimes they explode. Either way — I learn something.
