## Hey, I'm SALAH ⚡

I build, break, and rebuild things until I understand them.  
Currently diving deep into computer engineering, OS internals, and low-level C code.  
I like projects that make me *think*. But! I also care about *how* things look.

### Some things I tinker with
- **Linux** (I use Arch btw)
- **C** as my main language, plus a mix of other tools when needed: shell scripting, Lua, Python, Java, and more
- **Servers**, virtualization, and the _occasional bad idea_
- **Open-source projects** that teaches me something new
- **System customization** to the max: from CLI to TUI to GUI

### Philosophy
> *"If I can’t explain how it works, I don’t really understand it."*

### Elsewhere
GitHub’s my digital workbench... It's where I throw my experiments.
Sometimes they work. Sometimes they explode. Either way, I learn something.
